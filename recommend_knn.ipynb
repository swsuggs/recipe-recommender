    "# Recipe recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "In my mind, a powerful approach to recommending recipes would be if I could say something like \"of all people who liked recipes A and B, 75% also liked recipe C.  You like A and B, so you should try C too.\"  This would allow the discovery of other quality recipes, not necessarily similar to one I already know, but enjoyed by people with a similar taste.  However, I can't do this when I'm the only person I have data on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I must rely on features of the recipes themselves.  Since I did not scrape ratings, time required, or other meta-data, I have only the ingredients to go off of.  So, for a first pass at recommending recipes, I'll take a given \"loved\" recipe and find the k nearest recipes to it in the database.  There are drawbacks to this approach, namely a recipe with similar ingredients will not necessarily be as good, and moreover, if it's too similar, I'd probably rather stick with the recipe I already know.  The point is to discover new foods I wouldn't find otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the advantage of this approach is it's really easy to do.\n",
