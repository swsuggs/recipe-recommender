    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I improve my naive nearest-neighbor recommendation system with something a little smarter.  The matrix factorization approach assumes that there's some hidden features for both users and recipes.  The product of a user's feature vector with a recipe's feature vector should predict how well the user will like that recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the features for both users and items are learned by gradient descent.  Unfortunately, in my case, I'm the only user, which makes it impossible to learn features for recipes, as I haven't even tried most of them.  But I can use the ingredients as recipe features and learn user features for myself.\n",
    "\n",
